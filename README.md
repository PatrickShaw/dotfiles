# Vaernil's dotfiles of super fun and adventure

It's just a bunch of dotfiles for my linux machines. It's very WIP, haven't uploaded all the files yet.</br>
I'm still learning gentoo, basic scripting and git usage, so this is basically my sandbox, so don't look at me and my files judgingly :)

For now I decided to split it into 2 branches, depending on the computer I'm using. Might reconsider this and just use if hostname or something, but that wouldn't resolve all the issues.
I have no idea what master branch is supposed to be. Neutral configs I port anywhere I want? And then add the extras if needed? Dunno yet.
