# my-dotfiles

It's just a bunch of dotfiles for my linux machines. It's very WIP, haven't uploaded all the files yet.</br>
I'm always trying to improve it and learn something new, so don't look at me and my files judgingly :)

For now I decided to split it intwo 2 branches depending on the computer I'm using. Might reconsider this and just use if hostname or something, but that wouldn't resolve all the issues.
