# Vaernil's dotfiles of super fun and adventure

It's just a bunch of dotfiles for my linux machines. It's very WIP, haven't uploaded all the files yet.</br>
I'm still learning gentoo, basic scripting and git usage. This is basically my sandbox, so don't look at me and my files judgingly :)

For now I decided to split it into 2 branches, depending on the computer I'm using. Might reconsider it, as I learn more about git.
I have no idea what master branch is supposed to be. Neutral configs I port anywhere I want? And then add the extras if needed? Dunno yet.
I'm starting to lean towards using just one branch.

## TODO
* tweak vim colors and change few highlight groups
* try changing gtk colors so I can distinguish active chrome tabs from inactive ones
* write notification and popup scripts, dimensions should be based on text and geometry from where they were called from, basically I want them to show up bellow and perfectly centered, I could hardcore it but where is the fun in that
* move your modified vim themes to separate files
* migrate to zsh and  work on a prompt script
* add custom software/dependencies?
* fn keys
* backlight
* refactor
and much more
